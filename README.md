# Cachem WIP

A "database" without batteries included.
The idea is that the needed models and there necessary parsing to and from
bytes are implemented.
Thats why this repo only includes basic functions and wrappers for
a handfull of datatypes.
These wrappers can be used to build more complex structures that represent
the actual data.

Besides that, the "database" has no user authentication, query language
or something similar that most databases have.
This "database" can be more considered a thin wrapper for data that is
accessible over the network.

Instead of having tables or collections, this "database" has caches.
These caches are only in memory.
Only when configured these caches are saved to disk when the database gets
a SIGINT signal.
On startup those files are then loaded.

## Disadvantages

- Because everything is kept in memory, the memory allocation amount can be high, of course depending on the amount of data that is stored
- The caches are only saved to disk when a SIGINT (CTRL+C) is received, if the server crashes for some reason, there will be data loss
- There is no user authentication, query language or filtering besides filtering by id
- Initial manual work, but parts of it is supported by using proc macros

## Advantages

- Small protocol overhead, in most cases it is either 2 bytes or 6 bytes overhead
  - 1 byte: Action that should be performed (fetch, delete, update, insertt)
  - 2 byte: Cache that should be used
  - 3 byte to 6 byte: If an vec is transmited, this contains the number of elements in the vec
  - When sending strings the overhead gets higher, every string is 0 byte terminated
    - If you send a vec containing 100 strings, the overhead will be 106 bytes
    - The recommendation is to have a cache that only handles resolving ids to strings
- Fast
- The "database" is specific for one project, depending of what is stored, the model can be designed to be as efficient as possible

## Usage

Currently I do not plan to make this crate available over at crates.io.
Reason being that I donÂ´t want to spam crates.io with crates that are more or
less only for personal use.
If there is interest in publishing them I will consider it.

``` toml
# Cargo.toml

cachem_utils = { git = "https://github.com/lholznagel/cachem.git", rev = "INSERT_LATEST_GIT_REV", features = ["derive"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

The `cachem_utils` crate contains all needed traits and functions.
Most of the trait can be implemented using proc-macros.
For the proc macros, the feature `derive` must be added.

## The `Parse` trait

``` rust
use cachem_utils::Parse;

#[derive(Parse)]
pub struct MyCacheEntry {
  my_val_1: u32,
  my_val_2: String,
}
```

The `Parse` trait includes all functions that are needed in order to read and
write the model into and from bytes.
By using the proc-macro the trait is automatically implemeted.

The code above would boil down to this code:

``` rust
use async_trait::async_trait;
use cachem_utils::Parse;
use tokio::io::{AsyncBufRead, AsyncRead, AsyncWrite};

pub struct MyCacheEntry {
  my_val_1: u32,
  my_val_2: String,
}

#[async_trait]
impl Parse for MyCacheEntry {
  async fn read<B>(
        buf: &mut B
    ) -> Result<Self, CachemError>
    where
        B: AsyncBufRead + AsyncRead + Send + Unpin {

    Ok(MyCacheEntry {
      my_val_1: u32::read(buf).await?,
      my_val_2: String::read(buf).await?
    })
  }

  async fn write<B>(
      &self,
      buf: &mut B
  ) -> Result<(), CachemError>
  where
      B: AsyncWrite + Send + Unpin {

    self.my_val_1.write(buf).await?;
    self.my_val_2.write(buf).await?;
    Ok(())
  }
}
```

The `Parse` trait is also implemented for the datatypes `u32`, `u64`, `u128`,
`f32`, `f64`, `String` and `bool`.
With that models can be easily designed.
